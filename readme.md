# Technical portofolio centered around automated testing

Welcome to my technical portfolio! This repository showcases my skills in automated testing. 
Below, you'll find a brief overview of the structure and contents of this repository.

## Repository Structure
This repository is structured so each directory is using a different set of technologies, as the time of writting there are 2 directories, one for c# and playwright, and another one for webdriverio with typescript

### Webdriverio Typescript

This directory contains E2E tests written in typescript using webdriverio. It demonstrates how to set up and execute automated tests within a node environment.

- [webdriverio](./WebdriverioTypescript/)

### DOTNET Playwright

This directory contains E2E Tests written in C# using Playwright. It showcases my ability to work with DOTNET-based testing frameworks.

- [playwright](./CSharpPlaywrightPom/)
